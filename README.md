# FreeTextBox-3.3.1 source code


>FreeTextBox is no longer being actively developed and both the control and source are free to download. http://www.freetextbox.com/

Because the FreeTextBox official webside index page's download link is dead, the files here is the source code using ILSpy decompile the .NET Framework 4.0's FreeTextBox.dll


I don't have the copyright. Just for study.
